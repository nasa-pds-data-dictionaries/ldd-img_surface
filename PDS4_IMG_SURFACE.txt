   description            The telemetry_provider_id attribute identifies the organization or subsystem that supplied the telemetry data product to the producer of the raw (EDR) PDS data product. This is typically (but not always) the organization responsible for reassembling packetized data into a single product. These may vary by mission so the permissible values should be set by the mission dictionaries. 
   permissible value - value meaning
      TTACS - Test Telemetry And Command System

   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description             The instrument_mode_id attribute provides an instrument-dependent designation of operating mode. This may be simply a number, letter or code, or a word such as 'normal', 'full resolution', 'near encounter', or 'fixed grating'. These types may vary by mission so the permissible values should be set by the mission dictionaries.

   name                   image_type
   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The image_type attribute specifies the type of image acquired. This may be used to describe characteristics that differentiate one group of images from another such as the nature of the data in the image file, the purpose for which the image was acquired, or the way in which it was acquired. This attribute is very similar to the image_observation_type attribute, but is designed to resolve ambiguities in cases where missions utilize a naming convention for both specific images and more general observations, which consist of multiple images. In those cases, the latter may be described by the image_observation_type attribute. Some example values from MSL include 'Regular', 'Thumbnail', 'Reference Pixels', 'Histogram'. The set of permissible values should be set by a mission dictionary.

   name                   image_observation_type
   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description             The image_observation_type attribute identifies the type or purpose of an observation that may be associated with an image. Image observation types may include limb, black sky, spacecraft calibration, or other image attribute that may be used for identification. Observation types should not include features, regions, or standard target names. The set of permissible values should be set by a mission dictionary.

   name                   error_model_name
   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The error_model_name attribute specifies the method or algorithm used to create the error estimate. Each mission will define their own set of possible values. For MSL, the error estimation algorithm (XYZ and Range) are new, and will be continuously modified well past landing. Implemented algorithm names and descriptions are in the file pointed to by ^ERROR_DESC. The initial value is MIPL_CONST_DISPARITY_PROJECTED_V1, which means an arbitrary constant disparity error is assumed (in ERROR_MODEL_PARMS), which is projected through the camera models to approximate an error ellipse, which is then projected to the XYZ or range/crossrange axes depending on the file type.

   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The horizon_mask_elevation attribute specifies the elevation (in degrees) used as the horizontal cutoff in a mask file that, when applied to another image file, prevents the horizon and sky features in the image from being processed. If this attribute is not present in the product label, no horizon mask was used.
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Angle

   name                   derived_image_type
   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The derived_image_type attribute specifies how to interpret the pixel values in a derived image (or colloquially, the type of the derived image itself).

   name                   linearization_mode
   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description             The linearization_mode attribute specifies what kind of stereo partner was used to linearize the image (the process requires two camera models). 
   permissible value - value meaning
      Nominal - The image was linearized using the nominal stereo partner at the same pointing (whether or not the partner image was actually acquired).
      Actual - The image was linearized using an actual stereo partner image, which may be at a different pointing or rover location (e.g. long-baseline or re-pointed stereo). The actual partner product will be referenced by the Stereo_Product_Reference class.
      None - Linearization has not been performed.

   name                   linearization_mode_fov
   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description             The linearization_mode_fov attribute specifies how the linearized camera model's field of view (FOV) w as constructed (corresponding to the "cahv_fov" parameter in MIPL software). 
   permissible value - value meaning
      Minimum - Indicates the FOV is the intersection of the two cameras, which means some data are cut off and typically stretched horizontally, but there are no black areas.
      Maximum - Indicates the FOV is the union of the two cameras, which preserves the edges of the images but typically compresses the image horizontally, and creates black areas.
      Linear - Uses only the CAHV vectors, which tends to preserve the aspect ratio and scale of the original but both cuts off data and has black areas.
      None - Linearization has not been performed.

   name                   stereo_baseline_length
   version                1.5

   name                   geometry_projection_type
   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description             The geometry_projection_type attribute specifies the state of the pixels in an image before a re-projection has been applied. Describes if or how the pixels have been reprojected. Raw indicates reprojection has not been done; the pixels are as they came from the camera. These types may vary by mission so the permissible values should be set by the mission dictionaries.
   permissible value - value meaning
      Raw - Indicates the image uses a CAHVOR or one of the CAHVORE camera models.
      Linearized - Indicates reprojection has been performed to linearize the camera model (thus removing things like lens distortion). This means the image uses a CAHV camera model.

   name                   autoexposure_dn_max_threshold
   version                1.5

   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description             The autoexposure_percent specifies an early termination percentage for the autoexpose algorithm. If the measured DN threshold and the autoexposure_dn_max_threshold are within autoexposure_percent of each other, the algorithm treats the current trial as a success and terminates early.
   minimum value          0.0
   maximum value          100.0

   name                   autoexposure_pixel_fraction

   name                   solution_id
   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The solution_id attribute specifies the unique identifier for the solution set to which the values in the group belong. For certain kinds of information, such as pointing correction (pointing models) and rover localization (coordinate system definitions), the "true" value is unknown and only estimates of the true value exist. Thus, more than one set of estimates may exist simultaneously, each valid for its intended purpose. Each of these sets is called a "solution" to the unknown true value. The solution_id attribute is used to identify which solution is being expressed by the containing group. No specific naming convention is defined here, however it is recommended that projects adopt one. The intent is to be able to identify who created the solution, and why. Possible components of the naming convention include user, institution, purpose, request ID, version, program, date/time. The value is not case-sensitive.
